 * Notes: 
 *  here are the pins a nano uses digital pins 11, 12, and 13.
 *  While the Mega uses 50, 51, and 52
 *  Arduino Micro uses pins 14, 15, and 16.
 *  Additionally, another pin must be used to select the SD card
 *  You must use the 8.3 format when naming the sd card!!!
 *    EXAMPLE "NAME001.EXT" where “NAME001” is an 
 *    8 character or fewer string, and “EXT” is a 3 
 *    character extension
